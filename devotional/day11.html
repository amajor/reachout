                    <p>By faith Abraham went out to a place he didn't know. Doesn't that remind us of our lives sometimes? What does God mean when He gives us a new vision? Why does He want us to change, or why does He challenge us to do something we are uncomfortable with?</p>

                    <p>Abraham had the same thought when God instructed him to move his family and all he owned to a promised land. What faith it took for Abraham to follow God's vision! It was only by faith that Abraham was able to follow God.</p>

                    <p>We, too, are asked to walk in faith on our spiritual journey. God has asked us to follow Him by faith. Faith to live for Him and faith to follow His vision to Reach Out to others. To go and be disciples to all people as a congregation of believers.</p>

                    <p>We are called to live by faith: a faith to trust and to be assured He is with us always. Rest assured, God will give us what we need to fulfill His vision. May we all live by this type of faith.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes faith means stepping out into the unknown. Take a moment today to do something you've never done before. Maybe say hello to a new coworker, or read a book of the Bible you've never read.</p>

                    <p>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, you were with Abraham when he left his home to follow you. And I believe you are with me too. Help me to trust in you, even when that means doing something that seems scary or makes me feel unsure. Give me the courage to follow your leading. Amen.</p>
