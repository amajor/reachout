                    <p>In this day of fast internet, instant coffee and instant gratification, we sometimes forget that God has everything in his time and in his understanding. We want to rush here and there to get to something or someplace and once we are there, we're not sure what we have accomplished. The Gentiles in the passage wanted a quick meeting with Jesus!</p>

                    <p>In the passage from John 12:20-26 we see that Greeks wanted to see Jesus and went to the disciples to ask for an audience. It does not tell us why they wanted to see Jesus, but Jesus' response was to state that the "hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." He doesn't even respond to their request! Jesus had something he wanted to share with his disciples as a teaching moment.</p>

                    <p>We, at North Holland Reformed Church, are in a season to move forward with an expansion. Will everybody REACH OUT and support the effort? We hope so, but no matter what happens, we must remember what this passage says, "If anyone serves Me, My father will honor them." We at NHRC are here to serve GOD and our community and to give God the honor and glory. What better way to use our time and gifts than to let our light shine for the glory of God and our community!</p>

                    <p>When we realize that God isn't interested in fast everything but rather our long-term and consistent heart, we know that by our actions and through God's power, we can be the light shining before others, that they may see our good deeds and glorify our Father in Heaven!</p>

                    <p>God calls us to live in a different way than our culture teaches us is important. Take a moment today to turn off notifications on your phone or laptop to spend a half hour in prayer after work or school.</p>

                    <p>God, you are a God of consistency and faithfulness. In the busyness of our lives, it is often difficult to see and remember your long-term plan. Reveal in our hearts where you are calling us to commit to you, even though we cannot always see the big picture. Amen.</p>
