                    <p>I think the message of this text is clear: God is in control. Just like a parent who makes sure his kids have everything they need, God reminds us that he is the ultimate provider. He has been in the past, he is in the present, and will always be in the future. And, like a parent, God instructs his children to follow his commands. When we trust God to see things through, he shows us that he will always be faithful.</p>

                    <p>In this passage, God reminds the Israelites how he took care of them and provided for their needs. He reminds them that they were never lacking in any provisions because they trusted him.</p>

                    <p>God's message is the same for us as a church at this moment in time. God is showing us that he provided in the past, and will provide for us in the future â€” if we are faithful to who he has called us to be.</p>

                    <p>God message is simple. He reminds us that he is the only true God.</p>

                    <p>God has been faithful in the past, just as He is faithful today. Take a moment to remember God's faithfulness. Call or visit a loved one who is older than you, and ask them to share a story of a time God was faithful in their life.</p>

                    <p>God, our Father, you have provided us with everything we need. And like a parent, you want to teach us how to use what we have been given. As your children, help us to follow your leading faithfully. Thank you for walking with us in the past and continuing to guide us into the future. Amen.</p>
