                    <p>Psalm 24 is gorgeously written and creates a striking image in my mind – perhaps in yours as well – of grandeur. It paints a picture of a mighty King knocking on the ancient doors of the temple and being ushered in by those with clean hands and pure hearts. I cannot help but imagine a wealthy king coming home, maybe from war or after establishing some sort of treaty, and being adored by the people. If I’m not careful, I forget that the same King of glory who knocks on ancient doors is the One who, in the beginning, came close. This King breathed life into humanity; this King is, still, closer than your breath. This King is one who reaches out in vulnerability, reigning over a people who will not all acknowledge the knock on the door.</p>

                    <p>When we worship together on Sunday mornings at North Holland, we open up the doors and lift our heads to acknowledge the King. Psalm 24 was used as liturgy for entrance into the temple as a way of remembering that even though God is big, vast, and incomprehensible – the Owner of the world – this same God wants to be physically close; ruling from a home among the people.</p>

                    <p>Whenever you walk through a door today, remember that God is King. Remember to lift up the doors of your heart and allow God to come in. Remember that the God who created seas, rivers, and hills created you. Remember to care about that. How does knowing that God’s fingerprints are all over the world impact you? Where and how is God calling you to care for yourself, for someone you love, or for the creation around you?</p>

                    <p>The earth is the Lord's! Take a moment today to celebrate the goodness of the world God has created. Go on a walk in the neighborhood to pick up trash as a way to care for creation.</p>

                    <p>God of power and might, you created the world and everything in it. You are King over all creation, and King of my heart. Thank you for being a God who is not only Lord of all, but a God who cares deeply for me. I love you, Lord. Amen.</p>
