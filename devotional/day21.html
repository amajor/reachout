                    <p>It's not about me. Throughout this spiritual journey we've been examining our hearts, reading Scripture, and joining in prayer together as a community and individually as we wonder what it will look like for each of us to join in with the future God has in mind for North Holland. We've considered what it means to be stewards of the gifts God has given to us, we've read stories of faith and wondered what it means for us to be faithful followers of Jesus, we've learned what it means to sacrifice something we love for something we love even more.</p>

                    <p>As we come to Commitment Sunday tomorrow, we might be tempted to think this journey has been all about getting us ready to decide how much we're willing to give toward this project. And that's important. But it's helpful today for me to remember, it's not about me.</p>

                    <p>Galatians 2 tells us we "have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer [we] who live, but Christ who lives in [us]." As we've thought about stewardship, using our talents and money for God's glory, we've seen that the whole earth is the Lord's, including everything we have. God's in charge; we're not. We've seen that God calls us to be faithful, but it's really God who's the most faithful. Even when we fall short and turn away from God, God comes back for us. He will never let us go. And as we consider what it means for us to sacrifice, we see that Jesus Christ was the ultimate sacrifice, giving up his life for us, even when we didn't deserve it.</p>

                    <p>As we step into the future in our own lives and as a church, we recognize that it's not about us, it's about Jesus Christ, who gave himself up for us. This same Christ is in us and with us, whatever happens into the future. To God be the glory!</p>

                    <p>Jesus Christ, I was dead in sin when you came to me and raised me up to new life. Now the life I live, I live in you. Show me what it means to model the kind of sacrificial life you lived. Help me shine your light before others! Amen.</p>
