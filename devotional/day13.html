                    <p>Have you ever wanted to ask God a question? Have you ever wanted to ask for something but didn't? Have you ever felt in need of God's touch but didn't reach out to Him? In today's passage, Jesus is actually sitting down with His followers commanding them to ASK, to SEEK, to COME CALLING at God's door.</p>

                    <p>This passage suggests that as a follower of Jesus we need to have an active, personal relationship with God the Father. Think of a time that you wanted to ask one of your parents for something but were not quite sure how they would respond. You might have been hesitant and fearful of their reply. Jesus is stating that we have a heavenly Father who will give good gifts to those who ask Him. Start the conversation and trust that He is a loving God that hears your petitions.</p>

                    <p>The other part of the message has to do with persistence. We are commanded to seek as though looking earnestly for something and to knock incessantly at God's door. We must take the steps of seeking and knocking. Without these steps of faith, you are just asking God to read your heart and mind. James, the brother of Jesus wrote to the Christians in Jerusalem that they "have not because they ask not" (James 4:2). Start the conversation today with your loving heavenly Father.</p>

                    <p>Ask and you will receive. Take a moment to remember how God has answered your prayers. Write down three things you've asked for in the last year. How did God answer that prayer? What are you asking God for right now?</p>

                    <p>God of Love, Matthew 7 tells us that you love to give your children good gifts. Thank you for the ways you have blessed us! Give us the courage to boldly ask you for what we need. Help us to trust that you hear our prayers, and you will answer. Amen.</p>
