                    <p>God is faithful and can do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine! God works in amazing ways in our own lives and in the life of the church. As we consider the future of North Holland, we trust in Godâ€™s ability to use our building for his glory. And we want to surround the whole process with prayer.</p>

                    <p>Take some time today to go on a Prayer Walk at church. Take your family or call a friend from church to go with you!</p>

                    <h3 class="h4">Prayer Walk</h3>

                    <p>First, head to the Narthex. Look out the windows and imagine what God might do through the new space. Then, head outside the carport doors. Follow the guide signs and stop and pray at each of the following stations:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Central Entrance</li>
                        <li>The Elevator</li>
                        <li>The Wheelchair-accessible Restrooms</li>
                        <li>The Kitchen</li>
                        <li>The new Narthex</li>
                        <li>The Multi-Purpose Space</li>
                        <li>Then head inside to the current Fellowship Hall (new Youth Center)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Finish your time in prayer in the Sanctuary. Close your time with the following prayer:</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="pray" class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

                    <h2 class="devo-section h3">Pray</h2>

                    <p>God, you have been faithful throughout North Holland's history. I thank you for the people who make North Holland such a special place, and for the ministry that has already been done through this space and through your people. As we look to the possibilities of the future, I trust you with the outcome. Please me, God, and use this space for your glory. Amen.</p>
