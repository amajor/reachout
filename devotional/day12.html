                    <h2 class="devo-section h3">Reflect</h2>

                    <p>This passage is important because it tells us again what God should mean to us, that we need to trust him with everything we have. We are his. God is always there for us, and I can never repay him for all the ways that he has blessed me! This includes the blessing of our church family. As a young family at North Holland we were welcomed. North Holland was always a very important part of our lives and was always there for us and with us. We love North Holland, and we trust God as we look to the future!</p>

                    <p>Proverbs 3:5 says, "lean not on your own understanding." Take a moment to consider something you don't understand â€” about God, or faith, or something that's happened in your life. Talk to God about it. Ask God to help you trust in Him.</p>

                    <h2 class="devo-section h3">Pray</h2>

                    <p>God of Wisdom, we want to trust you with everything we have. Sometimes that's hard to do because we don't understand everything. Help us, Lord, not to lean on our own understanding. Instead, give us your understanding. Give us your heart, so that we may follow your will. Amen.</p>
