                    <p>God said, "Let us make human-kind in our image." This short sentence has a lot of meaning. When God says "let us" it's plural, meaning God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, all of whom were present at creation.</p>

                    <p>How are we made in God's image? God obviously did not create us exactly like himself. We aren't all-knowing or all-powerful like God. But we do reflect God. Though we will never be totally like God, we can reflect God's character in our love, patience, forgiveness, kindness, and faithfulness.</p>

                    <p>After God made man and woman He blessed them and told them to be fruitful and increase in number, to fill the earth and subdue it, and to rule over all the creatures of the earth. To "rule over" something is to have authority and control over it. We know that God has complete control over everything, but He delegated some of His authority over to us, and He expects us to take responsibility for the environment and the other creatures that share our planet. We must not be careless or wasteful. We must be good stewards with what God has entrusted to us.</p>

                    <p>God saw all that He had made and it was very good. Remember God made you and you are valuable to Him, so valuable that He sent His only Son to die on a cross for you!</p>

                    <p>God made us in his own image and entrusted us to care for his good creation. That includes ourselves. Take a moment to remember that you are made in the image of God. Go to your favorite place (a coffee shop, the beach, your favorite cozy chair). Check in with God. What are you thankful for? What are you anxious about? Where do you sense God moving in your life?</p>

                    <p>God of Creation, thank you for making me in your image. Thank you for giving me a role in caring for your good creation. Give me eyes to see how I might be a better steward of your world. Amen.</p>
